# Onboarding test branch
Use this branch to get accustomed to the git & github workflow, the current files are just a copy of the turret branch.

**Use `git clone [Repo URL] --recursive` to clone repos**, as not doing so will not copy the files needed from the [RAS KiCAD Library](https://github.com/ut-ras/KiCad_Library.git)

To get the URL for this onboarding branch use the green `<> Code` button and copy the URL.
